# Dr. Magnificent's Art Machine
This took me about 4 days. Funny because it felt like an eternity. It was an eternity of checking MDN's docs and staring at my code until I ended up dreaming about it.

I feel weird hosting my stuff on Github Pages so I'll have to clean up my Neocities and host it there.

I reckon that I'll update this thing in the forseeable future.... well, among other things, I would like to learn jQuery to streamline some of the UI bits here.

On to the next.
